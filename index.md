# Hello

I was born and raised in New York.

I've been interested in coding since I was in High School. Went into employment
as a computer tech for 4 years, got recruited by Microsoft. Realized I
wasn't coding anymore and decided I wanted to pursue my passion as a developer.

Now I build Rails backend JSON APIs with a separate React + Redux
frontend. I've even built some Android Applications. My skills consist
of Ruby on Rails, Node.Js + Express, React + Redux, Java + Android
& SQL (SQLite, MongoDB and PostgreSQL).

Feel free to send me an e-mail, read my blog posts or look at some of my work.

Thanks for Visiting.
