# Hello

I was born and raised in New York. I build Rails backend json api with a separate
React + Redux frontend. I've even built some Android Applications.

My skills consist of Ruby on Rails, Node.Js + Express, React + Redux,
Java + Android & SQL. (SQLite, Mongodb and Postgresql)

Feel free to send me an e-mail, read my blog posts or look at some of my work.

Thanks for Visiting.
